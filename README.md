## Introduction

This repository contains competition submission for CodeIT Suisse 2018, organised by Credit Suisse Hong Kong and Singapore. Since this is a two-day competition, the repository is a bit messy.

In short, the submission is in a form of a backend server, in our case written mainly with Node and bridges Python codes, full of RESTful APIs. The competition contains 11 algorithm or machine learning challenges, and as we receive inputs of the challenges from GET requests, we need to return the outputs within time limit.

The challenges are scraped by [dipsywong98](https://github.com/dipsywong98) and the backups are hosted at [here](https://dipsywong98.github.io/CodeIT-2018-site-backup/).

## Code Structure

Our solutions to the challenges are placed in `routes/`, in which the filenames reflect the challenges associated.
